# iOS
Water My Plants allows users to create lists of household plants and set specific times for them to be watered on a daily basis. Users are able to create new plants with a name, species, and desired watering time. Those created plants can then be accessed to update with new information, or can be deleted at any time. The user can also access their username and phone number information, and change those as well. 

Water My Plants was created in a four day period by a seven person team, two of which being iOS developers and the rest being web developers. The mobile app collaborated with the backend web developers on the database schema and endpoint structuring. 

The user is able to sign up with their unique username, password, phone number, and email address. This information is communicated to the API database and stored.

Returning users can sign up with their registered username and password.

New users can create their first plant by clicking the "plus" icon and entering information about the plant's name, species, and desired watering time.

The first time a user creates a plant with a set watering time, Notification Center is configured to ask them if they would like push notifications to be sent whenever the time comes that a certain plant is to be watered. This can be enabled/disabled in the Settings app.

After a user has created at least one plant, the home page will display a list of plants with their name and species.

After saving the updated information, it will appear in the user's profile page.

Even when the user is outside of the app, if watering times are set for a plant, a push notification will appear to remind them what time it is and which plant to water.
